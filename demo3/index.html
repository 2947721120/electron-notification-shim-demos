		<p>Just sending a Notification event to the main process, who will send back another event to us. You should see an alert() popup.</p>

			console.log('Sending Notification. It\'ll get intercepted by `electron-notification-shim` and create a new event (`notification-shim`) that gets sent to your main thread. In this demo the event handler in the main thread responds by sending a new event (`notification-shim-demo-event`) back to us, where we catch it and do an annoying alert().');
			new Notification('Hello!', {content: 'Notification world!'});

			const ipc = require('ipc');
			ipc.on('notification-shim-demo-event', e => alert(e));
